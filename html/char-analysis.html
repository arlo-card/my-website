    <article>
        <p>
            It first caught my attention in "WildC.A.Ts Special".
            <br><br>
            In this issue, Cole goes on a mission with Voodoo where they
            have to meet with one of his contacts so they can sneak into a nearby town.
            <br><br>
            In the middle of their conversation they get caught between a firefight, a clearly one-sided one against
            unarmed villagers and a military group who are only fighting out of fear of retribution from their leader.
            <br><br>
            Still, there are innocent people are dying and Cole, knowing all too well what can happen from his time in
            the military,
            jumps in to help the villagers.
            <br><br>
            The way that he goes in is strategic, methodological; he is every bit of the military man that he was
            trained to be and more.
            And usually comic books treat these kind of scenes very lightly and without any effect on the story.
            <br><br>
            That's to be expected though because he is the "hero" of the story.
            <br><br>
            These aren't fights, they're just tools to show how competent he is.
            <br><br>
            So he definitely afford to be the wise-cracking, gunslinging, arrogant character we know him to be, but
            here's the thing! He doesn't! Or rather, he doesn't <i>allow</i> the story to treat it like that.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead every soldier is taken seriously, any one of them could get lucky and hit him. Any one of them could
            kill him.
            <i> The readers believe this because
                Cole believes this.</i>
            <br><br>
            The way he takes them down is not callous but it is brutal and the knowledge that Cole's actions are
            actually just a form of mercy
            (His mindset at this point is: better to have a quick death than the one their leader might give them)
            makes it an empty victory.
            <br><br>
            In the end, when Cole stands alone with the villagers, there's no hiding the carnage and chaos that took
            place. Cole <i>killed</i> people and it's treated with the gravity that very rarely exists in comics.
            <br><br>
            The writers even touch on this when Voodoo comes to help him, she tries to lighten the mood by telling a
            joke and telling him he did a good job.
            <br><br>
            Instead of following the script, Cole actively rejects this interaction. He states something along
            the lines of it ("it" being humor) having no place next to corpses.
            <br><br>
            The next panels are solemn, just Voodoo and Cole's silhouettes as they walk away.
        </p>

        <p>
            That was honestly such a refreshing take on typical comic book scenes like that. Where death is tragic and
            irreversible, something that lingers even when our heroes move on.
            <br><br>
            By choosing not to engage in that classic
            witty banter, Cole
            forces the readers to think about what happened:
        <ul>
            <li>Who will mourn these characters?</li>
            <li>Is there a difference
                between evil and desperate?</li>
            <li>Should these people be a part of the exception?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>For Cole, he's forced to think about one question: Can the good ever outweigh the bad?</p>
