    <h2 class="titles">An Intro to Their Relationship:</h2>
    <p>Zealot and Grifter are a well known duo throughout the Wildstorm universe. It's unknown how long
        they've been traveling together but their initial meeting occured between the events of <i>Team 7: Dead
            Reckoning</i> and when they joined the WildC.A.Ts together. Their romantic relationship influences many
        of their interactions. As Cole is oftentimes the narrator for these comics, his feelings are much more
        explicit but Zealot is shown to harbor romantic feelings as well.

            Maul is thrown back from the hit, with a large onomatopoeia colored pink that reads, 'Thwack'">

                There are three of Grifter's thought-text boxes, two along the left side and one in the bottom right corner. The text reads 'I'm out the door before he can finish. Even 
                though the others needed me and I came through for 'em, I couldn't help but feel that I'd left Zealot hanging out to dry. 
                If it wasn't for her, I'd have planted myself six feet under at Arlington a long time ago. 
                I don't like the idea of losing two of my oldest friends on the same day! I may not have been able to save Lonely.
