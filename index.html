        <!--backstory-->
        <p> Before he was Grifter, he was Cole Cash.</p>
        <p>
            He had run away from his home at a very young age, turning towards a life of crime to survive on the streets.
            That time of his life ended with his arrest and subsequent recruitment from International Operations (I/O) where
            he developed strong marksman skills and steadily became a reliable soldier.
        </p>

        <p> 
            During his time with I/O, Cole joined a black ops. team known as Team 7. There he undertook top secret missions under
            the code name, <i>Deadeye</i>. However, on one mission Team 7 was deliberately exposed to a foreign chemical 
            called <i>Gen Factor</i>. They quickly developed psionic abilities but it came at the cost of their sanity.
            Suspicious of I/O and its intentions, Cole began to raise questions and once I/O had fully betrayed Team 7,
            he led the team to unite their abilities and hide from I/O. That was only temporary and the team went on a number of missions 
            before some members decided to leave.
        </p>

        <p>
            Slowly, his psionic powers began to dampen but he retained the physical aspects of the <i>Gen Factor</i>. He continued to work for I/O 
            for a bit longer than other members but eventually, he too, left I/O. This is when he met Zealot, a Kherubim warrior, who taught him 
            the ways of the Coda which helped his mental health and locked his powers. While they did share a romantic relationship, it ended amicably. 
            Cole remained by Zealot's side under the name Grifter, joining her and the WildC.A.Ts in the battle against the Daemonites.
