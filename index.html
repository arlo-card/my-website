        <p>Before he was <i>Grifter</i>, he was known as Cole Cash.</p>

        <br>

        <p>
            He ran away from his home at a very young age and turned towards a life of crime to survive.
            That time of his life ended with his arrest and subsequent recruitment from International Operations (I/O)
            where he developed strong marksman skills and steadily became a reliable soldier.
        </p>

        <p>
            During his time with I/O, Cole joined a Black Ops. team known as Team 7. There he undertook top secret
            missions under
            the code name, <i>Deadeye</i>. However, on one mission I/O deliberately exposed Team 7 to a foreign chemical
            called <i>Gen Factor</i>, in an attempt to develop a superhuman strike team. This was done without the
            team's
            knowledge or consent.
        </p>
           
        <p>
            Unlike the previous experiments, Team 7 (Save for Michael Cray) quickly developed psionic abilities but it
            came at the cost of their sanity. Suspicious of I/O and its intentions, Cole began to raise questions and
            once I/O had fully betrayed Team 7,
            he led the team to unite their abilities and hide from I/O. This was only a temporary measure and the team
            reunited
            for a number of missions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Slowly, his psionic powers began to dampen but he retained the physical aspects of the Gen Factor. He
            continued to work for I/O
            for a bit longer than other members but eventually he too left I/O. This is when he met Zealot, a Kherubim
            warrior, who taught him
            the ways of the Coda which helped his mental health and locked his powers. While they did share a romantic
            relationship, it ended amicably. Cole still harbors romantic love for her but Zealot's feelings are not as explicit.
        </p>

        <p>Cole remains by Zealot's side under the alias <i>Grifter</i>, joining her and the WildC.A.Ts in the battle
            against
            the Daemonites.
        </p>

        <q>Like I always told ya, Zealot, there are things worth fighting for and things worth dying for. The trick is
            in deciding on the right ones.</q>
